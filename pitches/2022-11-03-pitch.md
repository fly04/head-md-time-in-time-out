# It and I

*Routine shapes the way we live our lives, but in a sense it is imposed on us by external causes; it does not necessarily result from conscious and deliberate choices.*

I am responsible for a being who has not yet shaped it's way of doing things and who will accompany me. Through my interactions with the real world, It will build routines as the time passes. Does my actions correspond to It's aspirations? Am I willing to change my routines to better suit It's needs? What does this say about me? What do I do mechanically and what do I do deliberately and consciously?
