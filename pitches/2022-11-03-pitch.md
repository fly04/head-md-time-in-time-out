# It and I

*Routine shapes the way we live our lives, but in a sense it is imposed on us by external causes; it does not necessarily result from conscious and deliberate choices.*

I am responsible for a being who will accompany me. Through my interactions with the real world, It will build routines as the time passes. Does my actions correspond to It's aspirations? Am I willing to change my routines to better suit It's needs? What do I do mechanically and what do I do deliberately and consciously?
