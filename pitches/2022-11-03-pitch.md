# It and I

*Routine shapes the way we live our lives, but in a sense it is imposed on us by external causes; it does not necessarily result from conscious and deliberate choices.*

I am responsible for a being who has not yet shaped it's way of doing things and who will accompany me. My way of living will influence theirs, but my choices will or will not correspond to its ideals. What does this say about me? What do I do mechanically and what do I do deliberately and consciously? Is the way I live really aligned with my desires and aspirations?
