# It and I

## Pitch

*Routine shapes the way we live our lives, but in a sense it is imposed on us by external causes; it does not necessarily result from conscious and deliberate choices.*

A being observes my actions and interactions with the real world on a daily basis and over time integrates my routines. It expresses its personal preferencies through behavior in anticipation or in reaction to my actions. Its state depends on me. Am I ready to change my habits to make him happy or will I continue as I want to at the risk of making his life with me a hell or worse?
